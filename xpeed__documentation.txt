Terminology:
- Purchase: I assumed that the purpose of the form is to create a new purchase entity. So each form submitted, a new purchase entity inserted into the database. In the report page, show all purchase listings and search through them.

Feature:
- Show the form to create new purchase
- Add new purchase entity through “Add Purchase” form
- Form handled through jQuery Ajax
- Back-end form validation
- Cookie restriction to submit the form only once
- Show the report page with listing all purchases
- In report page search by date range and search by user id (e.g. entry_by field)

How to Run and Test (xampp):
- Unzip the folder inside htdocs folder of xampp
- You will get a folder "xpeedstudio" this is the project directory
- Create a Database using phpMyAdmin
- in the root of project directory you  will get "demo_table.sql"  
- Import "demo_table.sql" table into your database using phpmyadmin
- Set-up database connection in "getBdd()" method of "root/bootstrap/Database.php" class
- Hit this url "http://localhost/xpeedstudio/purchases/create" to get started with "Add Purchase" form



Routing Pattern:
- url: http://localhost/xpeedstudio/purchases/create
- domain: http://localhost/xpeedstudio/
- controller: purchases/
- action/method: create/

Known gotcha:
- Root directory name is not dynamic so the project root directory name must be "xpeedstudio"
